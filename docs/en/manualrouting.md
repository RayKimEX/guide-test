Hybrid Chatting [Gitple](https://gitple.io/en)

## Manual assignment

Manual assignment method is a way to put all chating into **Waiting** list because it is difficult for the agent to respond to the client's inquiry in real time.

It is convenient to use manual assignment in the following situations.
- There is a certain amount of client inquiries, but it is a burden to operate a dedicated agent.
- Customer inquiries are concentrated on a particular season. Therefore, a solution is required that can replace a dedicated agent.
- Although the service is not officially launched, it is needed to actively accept client inquiries 24 hours during the test period.
- You want to provide client service as if there is a professional agent in your office during your outside meeting.


#### How to set up
