# Event APIs

## Integration Setting

Setting guide for "**Settings > Integrations**" > "**Event APIs**".

* URL
  * REST API to POST
  * HTTPS is recommended for transport security.
* Secret
  * For each API call, a hash value for the payload is added to the `X-Hub-Signature` header to determine that it is a safe API call from the Gitple.
  * The hash value uses the digest of HMAC (sha256) based on the Secret you entered.
* SSL Verification
  * If you are using HTTPS, we recommend setting the `Enable SSL verification` to check whether it is a valid certificate.
  * Select the event type to apply (Binding Event)
* Events
  * Send external message(`send_external_message`)
    * `Send Message` menu will be shown at the customer info view.
      * Agent can send message to the customer.
  * Send session state event when closed(`session_state_open`)
    * When a session is created, the API is called by loading the session basic information.
  * Send session state event when closed(`session_state_inprogress`)
    * When a session is assigned to an agent, the API is called by loading the session basic information.
  * Send session state event when closed(`session_state_close`)
    * When a session is ended, the API is called by loading the session basic information.

## API Spec

* `Header` is commonly used.
* All of the time format is **UTC** `Date`.
