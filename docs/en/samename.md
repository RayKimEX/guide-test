Hybrid Chatting [Gitple](https://gitple.io/en)

## Joint name of agents

If you have decided on a name to use jointly,

all agents can change their `name` on the **profile** page.

?> Even if several agents use the same name as below, they can be distinguished internally because a **separate ID is specified in parentheses**.

| When selecting from the chat list | When changing agents |
|--------:---------:--------|
|![WS RoomList Samename](assets/images/wsRoomListSamename.png) | ![WS Transfer Samename](assets/images/wsTransferSamename.png)|

_The ID of the user is not displayed on the chat list so that the user can be easily identified._
